I developed this project with .NET MVC5 (code first DB) using Visual Studio 2013
Community Edition. It is a book list(keeping book title, author, publishing company,
publishing date, genre, and price information). This is aimed to a publishing company
or any other company from a different industory that uses relational database.
It facilitate obtaining book information as well as updating the records:
add, modify, and delete.

Run the solution file(.sln) from Visual Studio 2013.
